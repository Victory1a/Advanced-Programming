            Nearly one in five American adults lived with a mental health condition before the pandemic,
            according to the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0},
            and many experts believe the need for help is even more urgent today.
            The good news is that there are many meaningful ways you can volunteer to support mental health.

        <h2>1. Get Involved Locally</h2>
        <p>
            Local mental health and social service nonprofits often need volunteers for many different roles.
            Contact organizations in your area to find out what opportunities are available.
            If you’re having trouble locating them, check your local newspaper, library, or United Way chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider volunteering for causes that matter personally to you.
            For example, if someone you love struggles with Alzheimer’s disease or substance abuse,
            supporting those organizations may be especially fulfilling.

        <h2>2. Participate in Awareness Campaigns</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the year, organizations such as
            the :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (NAMI)
            host awareness events like Mental Health Awareness Month in May
            and Suicide Prevention Awareness Month in September.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can participate in existing events or help plan one by organizing a talk,
            distributing informational materials, or working with schools and community centers.

        <h2>3. Be a Lifeline</h2>
        <p>
            Crisis hotlines are a critical resource for individuals experiencing mental health emergencies.
            Many of these services rely on trained volunteers.
            Organizations such as the
            :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
            and the
            :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
            provide support for people facing depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Volunteers typically complete training and can make a life-saving difference
            by being there when someone needs help the most.

        <h2>4. Be an Advocate</h2>
        <p>
            Mental illness can affect every aspect of a person’s life, including their family and loved ones.
            Advocacy organizations work year-round to raise awareness, fund research,
            and influence public policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Groups like NAMI and the
            :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
            provide tools to help you learn about legislative priorities and communicate
            with government representatives to support mental health funding.
        </p>

        <h2>5. End the Stigma</h2>
        <p>
            Stigma remains one of the biggest barriers to mental health care.
            Taking a stigma-free pledge and sharing personal stories can help normalize
            conversations about mental illness.
